Homework 4

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:

GC-content: 0.43029262963

Problem 3:

It says that linenum is not defined, because the first time linenum is defined it is defined in terms of itself.  It raises an exception for linenum and not seq because linenum is the first to be referenced in the for-loop. 

Problem 4:

AT-content: 0.568993851852

problem 5:

C-count: 5879128
G-count: 5738773
T-count: 7661547
A-count: 7701287

problem 6:

the sum of the letters is less than 100,000 off from len(seq) and total_count.  I can't open fast files on my computer to check but I would guess it's because there are characters in the files that are not A's, T's, C's or G's.

problem 7:

AT/GC ratio: 1.32234161747

problem 8:

moderate GC content
