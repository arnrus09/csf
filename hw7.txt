You don't have to do the elections homework (Homework 5/7).

Commit and sync all of your project code into your repository, and update your proposal.txt
so that we know what all the files are called and how to run a demo of your work.

Do this by 5pm on Friday (11/22)

E-mail me and Colin when you've done this.
